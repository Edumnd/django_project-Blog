	<p>
		A blog is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.
		Among the best blog sites, Amazing Blogs is, by far the most popular blogging platform in the world.
